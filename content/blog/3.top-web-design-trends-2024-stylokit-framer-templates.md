## 1. Minimalistic Design

**Trend Overview:** Minimalism remains a dominant trend in 2024. Clean, simple designs with plenty of white space create a sophisticated and user-friendly experience. This approach reduces distractions and focuses the user’s attention on the essential elements.

**How Stylokit Helps:** Our templates are crafted with minimalism in mind. Each template offers clean layouts and well-structured designs that emphasize simplicity and elegance.

**How Stylokit Helps:** Our Framer templates incorporate microinteractions to elevate the user experience. From button animations to hover effects, these small details make your website more engaging and interactive. With Stylokit, you can easily add and customize microinteractions to suit your design needs.

## 4. Advanced Typography
